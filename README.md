## Certificate previews

Certificate cards lazy-load pre-generated first-page WebP images. Original PDFs are opened only when a card is explicitly clicked; image failures display “Preview unavailable” without downloading a PDF.

To add or replace a certificate, put its PDF in `public/certificates/`, run `npm run generate:certificate-previews` with Node 24 after installing dev dependencies, and add its metadata to `data/index.ts`. Keep `img` pointing to the PDF and set `preview` to `/certificates/previews/<same-basename>.webp`, preserving filename case. Include the generated assets in the change.

The generator sequentially renders every source PDF to a 576-pixel-wide, white-background WebP using PDF.js and `@napi-rs/canvas`. It exits nonzero on failure and overwrites matching previews without deleting stale files. Generation is explicit, not part of the build or browser runtime; deployment serves the checked-in images without native PDF rendering.
